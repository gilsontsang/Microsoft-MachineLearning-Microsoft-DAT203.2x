Classification
- Yes/No questions
- ex. given shapes, "Yes" it is the shape of a chair or "No" it is not in the shape of a chair

Loss Functions 
- l(yf(x))
- Measures classification error 

3 types of Loss Functions
(AdaBoost) e^-yf(x)
(Logistic Regression) log(1+e^-yf(x))
(SVM) max(0,1-yf(x))

Zero-One Loss Function
- Lose 1 point if yf(x)<0, otherwise lose 0 points > tells you if your classifier is right or wrong

Decision boundary for Loss Functions
yf(x)<0 ... (Decison Boundary) ... yf(x)>0
"very wrong" "sort of wrong" (Decision Boundary) "sort of correct" "very correct"
huge penalties <---> no penalty

Ockham's Razor 
- The best models are the simple models that fit the data well
- Hypothesis that predict equally well, we should choose the one with the fewest assumptions

Statistical Learning Theory
- Focuses on the balance between accuracy and simplicity (simplicity is also called Regularization Machine Learning) 
- Most common machine learning chooses a function f to minimize training error and complexity

Logistic Regression
> minimize the average loss of log(1+e^-yf(x))
